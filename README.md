# Fake Data Detection

The main objective here is to train or model which can predict whether a given article/data is real or fake. To achieve the goal, we are employing training neural network models like XLMRoberta, etc., and non-neural network model such as SVM, Logistic to measure the performance. 

## DataSet
The dataset contains English news articles scrapped from news papers which will be preprocessed based on the model requirements and trained. The datasets are available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The rearranged data into test and train sets named 'Train.csv' and 'Test.csv' and preprocessed data 'TrainProcessed.csv' and 'TestProcessed.csv' can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1AsNlzfkTljeGCTlHxGiFAdeT5v53jnxw
